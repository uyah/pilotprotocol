	//       mid-flight. Pings worked for a few seconds then dial
	//       timed out for minutes.

	//   (2) ensureTunnel only (no key exchange) → NAT-punch wave.
	//       ensureTunnel still issues a punch via beacon for non-
	//       relay-only peers, and the dial path that owns the punch
	//       takes 7-15s per peer to time out and flip to relay. With
	//       7 peers in a 1.4s burst, the daemon was busy doing
	//       dial-fail-over for ~70s after start. User pings during
	//       that window collided with the prewarm activity.
	//
	// Neither variant survives contact with a fleet that has many
	// trusted peers. Lazy-on-first-use is the right behavior: pay the
	// 600ms cold cost on the first send-message and let warm cache
	// handle everything after.
	//
	// Latency wins kept (independent of prewarm):

// T4.3 (P9/P10): The legacy heartbeatLoop spanned L4 + L5/L8 + L11 — registry

// observability heartbeat publish were chained off a single ticker, with the
// downstream concerns gated on a successful registry heartbeat. That violated
// P9 ("Layer-spanning loops forbidden") and P10 ("State ownership documented
// per block").
//
// The loop is now split into four goroutines, one per layer of state owned:
//
//   - trustRepublishLoop (L5/L8): regConn.Heartbeat + reRegister. Owns
//     registry-side identity republish state (consecutiveFailures, backoff).
//     Touches no tunnel state.
//   - tunnelKeepaliveLoop (L4): tunnels.RegisterWithBeacon. Owns the L4 NAT
//     mapping refresh against the selected beacon. Briefly RLocks tm.mu via
//     RegisterWithBeacon — the only loop that touches tm.mu per tick.
//   - handshakePollLoop (L11): pollRelayedHandshakes. Drives the plugin-tier
//     handshake manager (L11) by polling registry for relayed handshake
//     traffic. Touches no tunnel state.
//   - observabilityHeartbeatLoop (L11): publishes agent.heartbeat to the bus
//     so subscribers (webhook bridge, dashboards, plugins) can observe a
//     live daemon. Owns no transport, no registry state.
//
// Note on the per-tunnel transport keepalive (L4/L7 MsgKeepalive): the
// keepalive that pokes peers below the consumer-NAT 30 s idle window lives at
// TunnelManager.keepaliveLoop (tunnel.go), spawned by TunnelManager.Listen
// and tied to TunnelKeepaliveInterval — distinct from this daemon-level
// tunnelKeepaliveLoop, which handles the beacon-side NAT mapping refresh.
//

// d.config.keepaliveInterval(). A 0-5 s jitter is applied to the initial tick
