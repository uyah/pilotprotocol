// stress to (*ipcConn).ipcWrite. See [[X-Tasks/backlog/26-ipc-write-mutex-contention]]
// and [[X-Tasks/backlog/30-mutex-risk-map]] § fix #4.
//
// Wire format:
//
//	[uint32-len][uint8-cmd][payload...]
//
// There is NO request-ID on the wire — the per-message header is a single
// command byte (IPCEnvelopeHeaderSize == 1). The reqID parameter threaded
// through the handler signatures is always 0; it is a vestige of an
// earlier design and is NOT transmitted or echoed. Because replies carry
// no correlation token, the driver must NOT have more than one in-flight
// request per command class that expects a reply on a single IPC
// connection; the driver-side mitigation for this lives in common (it
// serializes request/reply pairs per connection).
//
// TODO(ipc-correlation): a backward-compatible correlation token could be
// added by introducing a new cmd that prefixes a uint64 token ahead of an
// inner cmd, leaving the legacy single-byte framing untouched for old
// clients. Not done here — it is a wire change and a client-side
// mitigation is being handled in common instead.
//
// reqID==0 likewise tags server-pushed, unsolicited messages — cmdRecv,
// cmdAccept, cmdRecvFrom, cmdCloseOK from the recvPusher path, and the
// fan-out broadcast in DeliverDatagram. Drivers route those by cmd.
//
// Ordering: server-pushed messages arrive in send order on the writer
// goroutine. Per-conn ordering for traffic on a single overlay connection
// (CmdRecv frames) is preserved because the recvPusher writes them
// sequentially.
//
// Concurrency model:
//   - sendCh has capacity ipcSendBuffer (256). Producers (handleBind,
//     handleHealth, etc.) push to it via ipcWrite.
//   - A single writer goroutine drains sendCh in order. Per-client byte
//     ordering on the wire is preserved.
//   - ipcWrite blocks until enqueue, conn-close, or ctx-cancel. The old
//     100 ms backpressure-timeout was removed because the driver waits
//     on a per-reqID channel and a silent reply drop wedged callers
//     forever (issue #99 root cause). With concurrent daemon dispatch,
//     a stalled writeLoop now applies backpressure to the dispatch
//     goroutine pushing the reply, which is the right shape — a slow
//     IPC client throttles the rate at which its requests are answered,
//     not the rate at which other clients are answered.
//   - Close() is idempotent and races-safe; once invoked, ipcWrite returns
//     ErrIPCClosed. The writer drains queued messages best-effort before
//     the underlying net.Conn is closed.
